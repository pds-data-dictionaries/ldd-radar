   version                1.23
   value data type        UTF8_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            Specifies whether the time samples are real values or complex value pairs obtained simultaneously for a data acquisition system. It does not imply a numeric format. Sample Type is whether the (usually voltage) samples are single real values or a complex number pair (a + ib), which depends on the hardware used. In either case, the numbers themselves can be any numeric type. In raw form, they are usually few-bit integers or pairs of few-bit integers. But they may get converted to floating point in processing.
